Introduction
In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing based approach, where we learn the parameters of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) graph filters optimized for clustering. The proposed approach is formulated as a two-step iterative optimization problem, focusing on learning interpretable graph filters that are optimal for the given data and that maximize the separation between different clusters.
